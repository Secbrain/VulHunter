# File and Folder introduction of Dataset2

## Contracts

The folder "Contracts" includes 579 Ethereum smart contract bytecodes in Dataset_2.

## Detection_result

The folder "Detection_result" describes the detection result of each method in detail. 

## Extracted_instances

The folder "Extracted_instances" shows the instances extracted by VulHunter.

## Labels

The folder "Labels" shows the labels of contract vulnerabilities in Dataset_2. The labels were given by [DefectChekcer](https://github.com/Jiachi-Chen/DefectChecker). In addition, the file "dataset2_train_test_names_labels.json" describes the contracts' names of the training dataset and test dataset used in the Benign:Malicious=2:1 experiment.

## Methods_detection

The folder "Methods_detection" includes the detection results of each method. Among them, the file "dataset2_result_Mythril.rar" shows the detection result files, the file "Mythril_audit_files_results_dataset2.json" shows the overall situation of the file audit, and the file "Mythril_files_holeloops_dataset2.json" shows the summary results of the method audit vulnerabilities. Also, the file folder "other_results" in ML-based methods (i.e., ContractWard and VulHunter) includes the detection results of other executions.
