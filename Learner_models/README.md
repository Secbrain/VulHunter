## results_models.xlsx

The file "results_models.xlsx" shows the detection metrics (i.e., accuracy, precision, recall, and F1) and their standard deviations of VulHunter with the above baseline models on Dataset_1, and the proportion of benign and malicious contracts is 2:1. It includes (i) metrics (e.g., ACC and F1) and their standard deviations of all vulnerabilities (e.g., *reentrancy-eth*); (ii) the total NAVG metrics their standard deviations of each vulnerability severity; (iii) the NAVG metrics and their standard deviations of each method. Note that, the models KNN and SVM have not standard deviations given their certainty predictions.
