# Detection_result

The folder "Detection_result" describes the detection result of each method in detail.

## results_2vs1.xlsx

The file "results_2vs1.xlsx" describes the detection result of each method in the experiment with Benign:Malicious=2:1. It includes (i) metrics such as ACC and F1 of all vulnerabilities (e.g., *reentrancy-eth*); (ii) the total AVG and NAVG metrics of each vulnerability severity, where the NAVG only covers the vulnerability categories that methods can identify; (iii) the AVG and NAVG metrics of each method. Note that sheet1 involves the AVG, and sheet2 shows the NVAG. Note that it also shows the standard deviations for the methods based on Machine Learning, i.e., TMP, ContractWard, and VulHunter.

## results_5vs1.xlsx

The file "results_5vs1.xlsx" describes that of the experiment with Benign:Malicious=5:1.
