# Dataset_vul_num
This folder illustrates the number of each vulnerability in Dataset_1 and Dataset_2, respectively.

## Dataset1.xlsx
The file "Dataset1.xlsx" describes the number of vulnerabilities (30 of categories) in Dataset_1 according to their severity. The labels were manually checked and supplemented by the verification results of muti-methods such as Slither and Oyente. They are publicly available to enable cross-checks from other researchers and further guarantee their accuracy. 

## Dataset2.xlsx
The file "Dataset2.xlsx" describes the number of vulnerabilities (8 of categories) in Dataset_2 according to their severity. The labels were given by [DefectChekcer](https://github.com/Jiachi-Chen/DefectChecker).
